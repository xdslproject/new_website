title: ASPLOS 2025 Tutorial
subtitle: Rotterdam, The Netherlands â€” March 30- April 3, 2025

We will be presenting [a tutorial](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/workshops-and-tutorials/) titled  _xDSL: a Python-based compiler ecosystem_.

## Abstract

The xDSL framework is a Python-based compiler infrastructure within the MLIR ecosystem. It aims to facilitate and speed up the prototyping of compiler concepts within MLIR without the hassle of C++-based (or other compile-to-assembly) project infrastructures.
This tutorial introduces xDSL's core concepts and practical implementation techniques through hands-on examples. In more detail, we will provide participants with the necessary information on 1) how to define, extend and combine IR dialects, 2) leverage the existing optimization capabilities to define transformation passes that operate domain-specific and across dialects, 3) lower dialects and interface with existing MLIR/LLVM workflows.
By the end, attendees will understand how to develop efficient, maintainable DSL compilers using xDSL's modular approach, and be equipped to integrate xDSL into their development workflows.
